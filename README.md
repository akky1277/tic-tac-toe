# 🎮 TIC-TAC-TOE WITH PYTHON

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to play alternately on the same computer. It demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures like lists.

The main goal of this project is to build logic for a classic game in a console-based environment and understand how to check for win, lose, and draw conditions programmatically.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To design and implement a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.

* To apply Python programming concepts effectively.

* To check winning, losing, and draw conditions logically.

* To provide a user-friendly console interface.

## 🧩 Features


  ✅ Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)
  ✅ Real-time display of the game board after every move
  ✅ Input validation to prevent overwriting cells
  ✅ Automatic check for win or draw after each turn
  ✅ Clean and interactive console interface

## 🧠 Technologies Used

*  Python 3.x

## 🧾 Requirements


Make sure Python is installed on your system.
You can verify by running:

python --version

## ▶️ How to Run


1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/TIC-TAC-TOE-WITH-PYTHON.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    cd TIC-TAC-TOE-WITH-PYTHON

3. Run the Python file:

   python tic_tac_toe.py

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game!

## 🧮 Game Logic


  1. The game board is represented using a 3x3 list.

  2. Players take turns marking positions with ‘X’ and ‘O’.

  3. The program checks after each move for:

  * A row, column, or diagonal match (winner)

  * A full board with no winner (draw)

  4. If a win or draw occurs, the game announces the result and ends.

## 📊 Example Output
Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!

 1 | 2 | 3

 4 | 5 | 6

 7 | 8 | 9

Player X, choose your position (1-9): 5

    |    |  

    | X  |  

    |    |  

Player O, choose your position (1-9): 3

Result: Player X Wins! 🎉

## 🔮 Future Enhancements


  * Add a single-player mode using AI (Minimax algorithm).

  * Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter or pygame.

  * Enable score tracking across multiple rounds.
